			<h2>The Cyclist</h2>
			<p class="_no_border">Simple, fast and low resource consuming Strava alternative app. The Cyclist was designed to be simple and light on battery app which provides all the main features that are provided by Strava. The main focus while developing this app was that the cyclist should be able to record all the details of his journey like average speed, path, distance, time, elevation. The interface is easy to use and even elderly people can use it without any hassle. The cyclist can record his journey and share it with their friends on Whatsapp, Facebook and Instagram.</p>
